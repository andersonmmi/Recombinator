# Reloaner
Decentralized marketplace that allows microloans to be combined and repackaged an unlimited number of times.

## Core Concepts
Reloaner is a **game** built on the xDai network that allows borrowers to originate loans from a combination of loans and become a lender.

The first goal of the game is to create a lively marketplace of loans where credit scores can be determined by 3rd parties through win/loss ratios, repayments totals, and default totals.

The second goal of the game is to study how induviduals perform in different points in the supply chain.  There are three different minigames in the supply chain. The first minigame is "Origination", where a player creates a loan and sells it directly to a consumer. The second minigame is "Combination", where a consumer purchases two loans and combines them into a complex loan which they then sell directly to a consumer. The third minigame is "Consumption", where a player endeavors to secure a loan and withdraw the funds in order turn a profit outside of the game and satisfy the loan within 24 hours.
